Scripter is an app that allows you to collect and manage scripts scattered across your Mac in one place.
With this app, you don't have to rummage through Finder or open a terminal to enter commands to find a script.

Scripter not only frees you from repeated terminal movements, but also makes script execution easier.
You can now run the script immediately when you select it in Scripter.

Scripter is the fastest and easiest way to manage your scripts.
